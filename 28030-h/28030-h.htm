<h1><big>RELUCTANT GENIUS</big></h1>

<h2>By O. H. LESLIE</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><i>It is said that Life crawled up from the slime of the
sea-bottoms and became Man because of inherent
greatness bred into him before the dawn of time.
But perhaps this urge was not as formless as we think.</i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Buos</span> was chastising Laloi
as they sped through
the ionosphere of the green
planet. But like the airy creature
she was, Laloi ignored
the criticism and rippled
zephyr-like through a clump
of daffodils when they completed
their descent.</p>

<p>"So pretty," she sighed.
She flung her incorporeal
substance around each flower,
absorbing their unified
beauty of scent, sight, and
feel. Buos shrilled himself
into a column of wind to express
his displeasure at her
attitude.</p>

<p>"Stupid, silly, shallow
thing!" he said. "If the others
only knew how you behaved&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you'll be glad to tell
them, of course," she said,
extending her fingers of air
into the roots of the wind-bent
grass. She rolled across
the hill ecstatically, and Buos
followed in grumbling billows
of energy.</p>

<p>"I don't carry tales," he
replied, somewhat mortified.
"But we're here as observers,
and you insist upon making
this world a plaything ..."</p>

<p>"I love it," she said happily.
"It's so warm and
green."</p>

<p>Buos whipped in front of
her angrily. "This is an assignment,"
he snapped, his
emotion crackling the air
about him. "We have a purpose
here."</p>

<p>"Purpose!" she groaned,
settling over a patch of
crowded clover. "How many
centuries will this assignment
last?"</p>

<p>"This world is young,"
said Buos. "It will take
time."</p>

<p>"But how long?" she asked
mournfully. "Our world
will be shrivelled and dead
before these people have the
knowledge to rescue us. Why
can't we spend our lives
here ..."</p>

<p>"And leave the others behind?"
said Buos stiffly.
"Selfish being," he said sadly.
"This world cannot support
one-fourth our number."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, I know," Laloi
said. "I do not mean to
say such things. I am twisted
by my sorrow ..." As if to
express her self-abnegation,
she corkscrewed out of the
clover and into a thin spiral
of near-nothingness.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Settle down, foolish one,"
said Buos, not unkindly. "I
know your feelings. Do you
think I am not tormented as
well, by the slow pace of
these Earth-things? Crude,
barbaric beings, like children
with the building blocks of
science. They have such a
long way to go ..."</p>

<p>"And so few <i>know</i>," said
Laloi despairingly. "A handful
of seeing minds, tens of
millions of ignorant ones.
Not even first principles&mdash;they're
stupid, stupid!"</p>

<p>"But they will learn,"
Buos said stubbornly. "That
is historical fact. Someday,
they will know the true meanings
of matter and light and
energy. Slowly, yes, slowly.
But in terms of their growth,
it will seem like great speed
to them ..."</p>

<p>"And in terms of our
world," said Laloi, spinning
sadly over the ground, "they
may be far too late ..."</p>

<p>"No!" In his excitement,
Buos forgot himself and entwined
with the flowing form
of the she-creature, and the
result was a rending of the
air that cracked like heat
lightning over the field. "No,"
he repeated again. "They
must not be too late. They
must learn. They must build
from the very ground, and
then they must fly. And then
their eyes must be lifted to
the stars, and desire must extend
them to all the universe ..."</p>

<p>"It seems so hopeless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It cannot be! Our destiny
is not extinction. They must
come to us, in fleets of silver,
and replant our soil, and send
towers of green shooting into
our sky, breathing out air."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" Laloi cried pitifully.
"It will be that way,
Buos. It will be that way!
That man-creature, we will
begin with him ..."</p>

<p>Buos floated earthward disconsolately.
"He is a dreamer,"
he said cheerlessly. "His
mind is good; he thinks of
tomorrow; he is one of the
knowing ones. But he cannot
be moved, Laloi. His thoughts
may fester and die in the
prison of his brain ..."</p>

<p>"No, they will not! We
have watched him. He understands
much. He will help
us!"</p>

<p>"I have seen his like before,"
said Buos hopelessly.
"He thinks and he works, and
his conclusions will die stillborn,
for lack of a moving
force ..."</p>

<p>"Then let us provide it,
Buos. Let us move him!"</p>

<p>"With what?" said the
other disdainfully. "Arms of
nothing? Hands of vacuum?
A breeze against his cheek?
A rustle of leaves? A meaningless
whistle in his ear?"</p>

<p>"Let us try. Let us try!
This empty watchfulness is
destroying us. Let us move
him, Buos. Come!"</p>

<p>Faster than the sky-sweeping
clouds they flew, over the
gently swelling hills, over the
yearning branches of the
trees, over the calm blue
waters of the lakes. Swifter
than the flight of birds they
came, searching for a thinking
mind ...</p>

<p>They found him at last.</p>

<p>"He knows, he knows,"
said Laloi. "Only now to say
'this is so because' and 'this
must happen when'! Only to
think&mdash;to understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>They hovered over his
head, in a pandemonium of
helplessness. They whirled,
and tumbled, and shrilly circled.
And then to Laloi the
inspiration came.</p>

<p>The apple, caught by a sudden
gust of wind, twisted
from the tenuous hold of the
tree and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>The man, startled, picked
it up.</p>

<p>He gazed at it, deep in
thought.</p>
